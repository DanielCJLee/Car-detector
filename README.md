# Car-detector

Primarily used on a self localizing bot to detect cars, if any, in its path.
Achieved an accuracy of 93% on provided testData while using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
Have successfully completed 13 stages of training.

# Ongoing
Currently tewaking parameters and experimenting with LBP (Local Binary Patterns) to achieve more accuracy.
You would start concentrating on negative dataSet once you realize that negative images have a great influence on the overall accuracy of detector.
